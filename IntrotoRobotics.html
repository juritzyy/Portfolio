<h4 style="color:blue; font-size: 300%; text-align:center">Intro to Robotics</h4>

<b style="font-size:250%"> How have your ideas of robotics changed? What makes you excited about the future of robotics? Nervous? </b>

<p style= "text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:110% "> My ideas of robotics have changed because I was able to learn some different ways that robots are used. One particular way that they are used is programming robots so they are helping people with disabilities. <p/> 

<b style="font-size:200%"> You worked on circuits in groups, and will be working in groups for the rest of the week. What worked well? What could you do better next time? </b>

<p style= "text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:110% "> I think working in groups was really good. Something that worked well was being able to make a google docs document and sharing it with everyone in the group to be able to finish alot faster and share our ideas easily. Next time I think we would do the exact same thing because we were great! </p>
