<h4 style="color:blue; font-size: 300%; text-align:center">Intro to Robotics</h4>

<b style="font-size:250%; margin: 30px;"> How have your ideas of robotics changed? What makes you excited about the future of robotics? Nervous? </b>

<p style= "text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:160%; "> My ideas of robotics have changed because...  <p/> 
<p id="demo" style="display:none ;text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:160%;"> I was able to learn some different ways that robots are used. One particular way that they are used is programming robots so they are helping people with disabilities </p>

 <b style="font-size:200%;margin: 20px; "> You worked on circuits in groups, and will be working in groups for the rest of the week. What worked well? What could you do better next time? </b>

<p style= "text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:160%; "> I think working in groups was really good. Something that worked well was...  </p> 
  <p id="demo1" style="display:none ;text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:160%;"> being able to make a google docs document and sharing it with everyone in the group to be able to finish alot faster and share our ideas easily. Next time I think we would do the exact same thing because we were great!

<h4 style="color:blue; font-size: 300%; text-align:center">Intro to Robotics-BLINKING LED'S</h4>
 
  
<b style="font-size:250%; margin: 30px;"> How did your team work together on the lightshow? How could your teamwork have improved? What are the basic pieces of every arduino sketch? </b>

<p style= "text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:160%; "> We worked in pairs for the light show. We tried...  </p>
  <p id="demo2" style="display:none ;text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:160%;"> searching up what it was we wanted our light show to do. Also we asked for help alot. Once we got hte basic format down we decided to change the timing of each LED. If I could have changed something that we did it would have been not having the lights go at random times but have it more condinated. </p>

<b style="font-size:250%; margin: 30px;"> What are the basic peices of every Arduino sketch? </b>
 
<p style= "text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:160%; "> The basic pieces of an Arduino are the loop and the setup. The set up is where you put what your elements are going to be in your Arduino. And then your loop is what you actually want your Robot to do over an dover again. <p/>
 
<h4 style="color:blue; font-size: 300%; text-align:center">Intro to Robotics-Dance Party </h4>

<b style="font-size:250%; margin: 30px;"> What have you learned about cicuits that you did not know before? </b> 
 
<p style= "text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:160%; "> Before working with the Robot today I didn't know anything about circuits. Now I have learned how to creat a circuit, and how to make the robot do what I told it to do. </p>

<b style="font-size:250%; margin: 30px;"> What was your favorite part of your robots dance? </b>
 
<p style= "text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:160%; "> My famorite part of the dance was the whole thing because GO GO ROBO is the best robot out there <p/>

<h4 style="color:blue; font-size: 300%; text-align:center">Intro to Robotics- Escape BOT</h4>
  
<p style= "text-align:center;margin: 30px; font-size:160%; "> Today I learned how to add sound to our arduino and make our robot change direction when the aduino encountered an obsticle.
